                            <p>Hello! My name is Jessica. I graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a degree in Astronomy with minors in Museum Studies and Classical Civilization. I have worked with telescopes on UT's campus in Austin and McDonald Observatory in West Texas. I am currently working at Reimers Observatory in Dripping Springs when not using my own telescopes. I would love to bring the universe to you and explore the wonders of the night sky!</p>

I have different options that will work for you! If we don't catch an object for you, set up a notifications for when that object is back in the visible sky, that way we can get you that photo!</p>
